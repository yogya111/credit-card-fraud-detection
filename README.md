# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It aims to help reduce financial loss by identifying suspicious activity.

## 📌 Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a major concern in the financial sector. This project uses a dataset of transactions and applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is from [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection (June 25, 2015)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qnqfbqfqo/credit-card-fraud-detection-date-25th-of-june-2015) and contains anonymized transaction details.

## 🛠️ Steps Involved
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Handling class imbalance
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Performance metrics analysis
